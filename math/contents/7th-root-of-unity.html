<h2>Calculating the 7th Root of Unity</h2>

<p>
  On the 7th root of unity, the following equation is known.
</p>

`cos((2pi)/7) = 1/6 (-1 + root 3 ((7 + 21 sqrt 3 i) / 2) + root 3 ((7 - 21 sqrt 3 i) / 2))`

<p>
  We calucuate this value in the following code.<br/>
  We utilize the fact that the Galois group of the following equation has same structure with the multiplicative group of `ZZ//7ZZ-{0}`.
</p>


`x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0`
